# 11-Web-Design-Challenge

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a website to diplay our weather data using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  I created 4 pages:
    - Landing Page (hompage to show description and links to visuals)
    - Visualization Page (visuals of the selected data)
    - Comparisons Page (visuals of all plots to show a comparison between each)
    - Data Page (table of the data from the given CSV file)
